# 英地典
英地典 is a project to create a Chinese-English dictionary of UK place names. As the main Chinese-English dictionaries are missing Chinese translations for even the biggest UK cities, this project aims to document all existing translations for UK place names, and to establish new standardized translations for place names that don't already have Chinese translations.

## Using the Dictionary
A searchable webpage version of 英地典 can be found [here](https://elliottjones.net/yingdidian/).

### Format
英地典 uses a csv file to store all records.

英地典 entries do not include generic toponyms (e.g., 市/City) after the place name.

Please reference the existing entries in the csv file for how to format an entry.

### Submitting Entries
Please create a pull request once you have added an entry that is ready to be published.

After review, if the entry is valid, it will be published to the dictionary.
